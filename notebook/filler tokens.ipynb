Then there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. We need to find OC², which is p/q, and then compute p + q.\n",

      "Alright, let's start by visualizing the problem. Points O, A, and B are given. A is on the x-axis at (0.5, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, √3/2). The first quadrant is where both x and y are positive. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "So, for example, a segment from P(a, 0) to Q(0, b) would have length √(a² + b²) = 1. Therefore, a² + b² = 1. Since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, these segments are the hypotenuses of right triangles with legs a and b, both positive.\n",

So, C is a point on AB that is not on any other segment from F, except AB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our task is to find OC², where O is the origin, and then express it as a fraction p/q and find p + q.\n",

So, the line is going from (0, √3/2) to (1/2, 0). Therefore, for x between 0 and 1/2, y is positive. For x beyond 1/2, y becomes negative. Therefore, the line AB is in the first quadrant for x between 0 and 1/2, and in the fourth quadrant for x > 1/2.
