      "Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), right? I remember that to convert from rectangular (x, y) to polar coordinates, there are some formulas involved. Let me try to recall them.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 0 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 1 START\n",
      "I think the first thing I need to find is r, which is the distance from the origin to the point. I remember that formula is r = sqrt(x² + y²). So, since the point is (0, 3), let me plug in the values. x is 0 and y is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculating r: sqrt(0² + 3²) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That seems straightforward.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 1 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 2 START\n",
      "Now, the next part is finding θ, the angle. I think θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. The formula for θ is arctangent of y over x, right? So θ = arctan(y/x). Let's plug in the values. y is 3 and x is 0.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 2 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 3 START\n",
      "Wait, arctan(3/0). Hmm, division by zero. That seems tricky. I remember that when x is 0, the angle is either π/2 or 3π/2, depending on the sign of y. So, since y is positive (3), it should be in the positive y direction, which is straight up along the y-axis. So, θ should be π/2.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 3 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 4 START\n",
      "But just to make sure, let me think again. When x is 0, the point lies along the y-axis. Since y is positive, it's 3 units up from the origin. So, that's 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 4 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 5 START\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes people get confused with negative angles or angles measured differently. Let me visualize this. If I'm plotting (0,3) on the rectangular coordinate system, it's on the positive y-axis. So, in polar coordinates, that would be 90 degrees or π/2 radians away from the positive x-axis. So, yes, θ is π/2.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 5 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 6 START\n",
      "Is there any other way to confirm this? Maybe by thinking about the coordinates. Since r is 3 and θ is π/2, then in polar coordinates, the point should be (3, π/2). Let me check if this is correct.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 6 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 7 START\n",
      "In polar coordinates, the conversion formulas are x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. Let me apply that. If r is 3 and θ is π/2, then x should be 3 cos(π/2) and y should be 3 sin(π/2). Cos(π/2) is 0, and sin(π/2) is 1. So, x is 0 and y is 3. That matches the original rectangular coordinates, so it seems correct.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 7 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 8 START\n",
      "Wait, did I mix up θ in the formulas? Let me make sure. The formulas are x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. So, we have x = 0, y = 3. So, 0 = 3 cos θ and 3 = 3 sin θ. Therefore, cos θ = 0 and sin θ = 1. The angle that satisfies both is π/2, because cos(π/2) is 0 and sin(π/2) is 1. So, that's correct.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 8 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 9 START\n",
      "Is there another possibility? Well, could θ be 3π/2? If θ was 3π/2, cos θ would be 0 and sin θ would be -1, which would give us y = -3, which doesn't match our original point (0, 3). So, θ can't be 3π/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about negative angles? If we think of θ as pointing in the positive direction, 3π/2 would be pointing downward, which is not the case here. So, θ is definitely π/2.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 9 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 10 START\n",
      "Let me think about the unit circle. At π/2, the point is (0,1), which is 1 unit up on the y-axis. So, scaling that up by a factor of 3, it would be (0,3). That makes sense.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 10 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 11 START\n",
      "I guess another way to think about it is using the arctangent function. Since x is 0, and y is positive, the angle is π/2. If x were negative and y were positive, the angle would be in the second quadrant, like π - arctan(y/x). But in this case, x is 0, so we don't have to consider that.\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 11 END\n",
      "\n",
      ">>>>>CHUNK 12 START\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates of (0,3) should be (3, π/2). Let me just write that in the requested format: (r, θ) = (3, π/2).\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think I made any mistakes here. The conversion seems straightforward because the point is on the y-axis, so it's a simple matter of determining the angle. Just to recap:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Calculate r: sqrt(0² + 3²) = 3\n",
      "2. Calculate θ: arctan(3/0) = π/2\n",
      "3. Verify using conversion formulas.\n",

      "First, I remember that in a triangle, the sum of any two sides has to be greater than the third side. That's called the triangle inequality theorem. So, I think I can use that here. Let me write that down: for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, the following must be true:\n",

      "Now, the second inequality: a + c > b. Substituting the known values, that's 1 + c > 3. Let me solve for c here. Subtract 1 from both sides: c > 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, c has to be greater than 2.The third inequality is: b + c > a. Plugging in the values, it's 3 + c > 1. Hmm, well, since c is a positive integer, this inequality will always be true because 3 plus any positive integer is definitely greater than 1. So, this doesn't give me any new information; it's automatically satisfied.Now, putting it all together, from the first two inequalities, we have that c must satisfy 2 < c < 4. But c has to be an integer. So, let me list the integers between 2 and 4. The integers greater than 2 and less than 4 are just 3. So, c must be 3.\n",

      "   - Two sides of the triangle are 1 unit and 3 units. Let's denote them as \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\).\n",
      "   - The third side is an integer, denoted as \\( c \\).\n",

      "2. **Apply the Triangle Inequality Theorem:**\n",
      "   - For any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n",
      "   - This gives us three inequalities:\n",
      "     1. \\( a + b > c \\)\n",
      "     2. \\( a + c > b \\)\n",
      "     3. \\( b + c > a \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Substitute the Known Values:**\n",
      "   - Substitute \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\) into each inequality:\n",
      "     1. \\( 1 + 3 > c \\) simplifies to \\( c < 4 \\).\n",
      "     2. \\( 1 + c > 3 \\) simplifies to \\( c > 2 \\).\n",
      "     3. \\( 3 + c > 1 \\) is always true since \\( c \\) is a positive integer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Determine the Possible Values of \\( c \\):**\n",
      "   - From the first two inequalities, we have \\( 2 < c < 4 \\).\n",
      "   - Since \\( c \\) must be an integer, the only possible value is \\( c = 3 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Verification:**\n",
      "   - Check if \\( c = 3 \\) satisfies all triangle inequalities:\n",
      "     1. \\( 1 + 3 > 3 \\) → \\( 4 > 3 \\) (True)\n",

      "Okay, so I've got this problem here: If \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \\), what is the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\)? I need to express the answer as a common fraction. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that to find the value of a function at a specific point, I just substitute that point into the function wherever there's an \\( x \\). So, I need to calculate \\( f(-1) \\), \\( f(-0) \\), and \\( f(5) \\) separately and then add them up. Sounds straightforward, but I should make sure I do each step correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start with \\( f(-1) \\). Plugging \\( x = -1 \\) into the function:\\( f(-1) = \\frac{8(-1) - 1}{(-1) - 1} \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculating the numerator: \\( 8 \\times (-1) = -1 \\), so \\( -1 - 1 = -1 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the denominator: \\( (-1) - 1 = -1 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, \\( f(-1) = \\frac{-1}{-1} \\). Hmm, negative divided by negative is positive, so that's \\( 1 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so \\( f(-1) \\) is 1. That wasn't too bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's find \\( f(-0) \\). Substituting \\( x = -0 \\):\\( f(-0) = \\frac{8(-0) - 1}{(-0) - 1} \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculating the numerator: \\( 8 \\times (-0) = -8 \\), so \\( -8 - 1 = -8 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Denominator: \\( (-0) - 1 = -8 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, \\( f(-0) = \\frac{-8}{-8} \\). Again, negative divided by negative is positive, so that's \\( \\frac{8}{8} \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so \\( f(-0) \\) is \\( \\frac{8}{8} \\). Got that.\n",
