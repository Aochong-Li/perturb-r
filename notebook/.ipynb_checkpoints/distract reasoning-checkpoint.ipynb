So, if the domain is all real numbers except 0, then that would mean that a = 0 and b is... Wait, but if the domain is x < a or x > b, then if a is 0, then x < 0 or x > b. But then what is b? If the domain is all real numbers except 0, then there is no b because there's only one point excluded. But the problem says \"x < a or x > b\", so there must be two values, a and b, such that the domain is x < a or x > b. So, maybe the domain is actually all real numbers except between a and b, which would be the case if x² is positive except between a and b. But since x² is positive everywhere except at x = 0, so the domain is all real numbers except x = 0. Therefore, the domain is x < 0 or x > 0. So, in that case, a is 0 and b is... but wait, if the domain is x < a or x > b, then if a is 0 and b is something else? Wait, no. If the domain is x < a or x > b, and if the function is defined for all x except between a and b, then a and b must be such that a < 0 and b > 0? Wait, no. Wait, if the domain is x < a or x > b, then the values between a and b are excluded. So, if the domain is x < a or x > b, then the only excluded value is between a and b. So, if the domain is all real numbers except between a and b, then the function log(x²) is defined for x < a or x > b. But since x² is zero only at x = 0, then the excluded interval is (a, b) = (0, 0)? Wait, that can't be. Because if a and b are both 0, then the domain would be x < 0 or x > 0, which is correct. But in that case, a = 0 and b = 0? But then the domain is x < 0 or x > 0, so a is 0 and b is 0? But then a + b would be 0. But that seems too simple. But maybe that's the case?\n",
