      "But wait, let me clarify: If x dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali, that means Denali gets x more, and Nate loses x. So yes, Denali walks 16 + x, and Nate walks 12 - x. However, we should note that if x is more than 12, then 12 - x would become negative, which doesn't make sense. So, I think x must be less than or equal to 12. But the problem doesn't specify whether x is positive or negative, but since it's a group size, I think x is a positive integer.\n",

      "But in the first scenario, Denali walks 4x more. So if 4x is positive, that's fine, but if 4x is more than 16, then Denali would have more dogs than she was assigned. Wait, no, in the first scenario, Denali is walking 4x more than her original 16, so her total would be 16 + 4x. So 4x can be any positive number, but since x is a group size, it must be a positive integer. But in the second scenario, if we subtract x from 12, it's possible that 12 - x could be negative, but we have to assume x is such that 12 - x is non-negative. So x must be less than or equal to 12.\n",

So, assuming they are paid per dog, so Denali's pay is D * p and Nate's pay is N * p, where p is the pay per dog. But then, the ratio would be D/N.

But in the problem, it's about the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay being the same under different assignments. So, the pay is proportional to the number of dogs each walks.
