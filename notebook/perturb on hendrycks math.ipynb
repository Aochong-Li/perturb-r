Since \\\\(n + 5\\\\) and \\\\(n + 11\\\\) differ by 6, the only way for their gcd to be 3 is if they are both multiples of 3 but not multiples of 9. This means \\\\(n \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}\\\\) and \\\\(n \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{3}\\\\). So, \\\\(n\\\\) can be any number of the form \\\\(3k + 1\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is an integer. For example, \\\\(n = 1, 4, 7, 10, \\\\ldots\\\\).\\n\\n4. **Check if \\\\(d = 6\\\\) is possible:**\\n   If \\\\(d = 6\\\\), then both \\\\(n + 5\\\\) and \\\\(n + 11\\\\) must be divisible by 6. This means \\\\(n \\\\equiv -5 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{6}\\\\) and \\\\(n \\\\equiv -11 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{6}\\\\). So, \\\\(n \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{6}\\\\). For example, if \\\\(n = 1\\\\), then \\\\(n + 5 = 6\\\\) and \\\\(n + 11 = 12\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\gcd(6, 12) = 6\\\\). So, \\\\(d = 6\\\\) is possible. But we need to check if there are any other values of \\\\(n\\\\) that can give us \\\\(\\\\gcd(n + 5, n + 11) = 6\\\\). Since \\\\(n + 5\\\\) and \\\\(n + 11\\\\) differ by 6, the only way for their gcd to be 6 is if they are both multiples of 6. This means \\\\(n \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{6}\\\\). So, \\\\(n\\\\) can be any number of the form \\\\(6k + 1\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is an integer. For example, \\\\(n = 1, 7, 13, 19, \\\\ldots\\\\).\\n\\nNow, let's count the number of different three-digit numbers that can be represented by \\\\(ab5\\\\). Since \\\\(n = 100a + 10b + 5\\\\), we need to find the number of valid pairs \\\\((a, b)\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are digits (0-9) and \\\\(n\\\\) is a three-digit number. The value of \\\\(n\\\\) must be between 100 and 995. We need to check the possible values of \\\\(n\\\\) that satisfy the conditions we found.\\n\\n1. For \\\\(d = 1\\\\), \\\\(n\\\\) can be any odd number between 100 and 995. There are \\\\(\\\\frac{995 - 101}{2} + 1 = 453\\\\) such numbers.\\n2. For \\\\(d = 2\\\\), \\\\(n\\\\) must be odd and \\\\(n \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{3}\\\\). There are \\\\(\\\\frac{995 - 101}{6} + 1 = 150\\\\) such numbers.\\n3. For \\\\(d = 3\\\\), \\\\(n\\\\) must be of the form \\\\(3k + 1\\\\) and \\\\(n \\\\not\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{9}\\\\). There are \\\\(\\\\frac{995 - 101}{3} + 1 - \\\\frac{995 - 101}{9} = 301\\\\) such numbers.\\n4. For \\\\(d = 6\\\\), \\\\(n\\\\) must be of the form \\\\(6k + 1\\\\). There are \\\\(\\\\frac{995 - 101}{6} + 1 = 150\\\\) such numbers.\\n\\nThe total number of different three-digit numbers that can be represented by \\\\(ab5\\\\) is the sum of the valid numbers for each case. However, since we are asked for the number of different three-digit numbers, we need to consider the distinct values of \\\\(n\\\\). The distinct values of \\\\(n\\\\) are the numbers between 100 and 995 that satisfy the conditions we found. The number of such distinct values is the sum of the valid numbers for each case, which is \\\\(453 + 150 + 301 + 150 = 1054\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the number of different three-digit numbers that can be represented by \\\\(ab5\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\boxed{300}\\\\).\""

      " So I need to find the value of \\(a\\) such that the function \\(f(n)\\) is continuous at \\(n = a\\). The function is defined as follows: \\[f(n) = \\begin{cases} 4n + 3 & \\text{if } n < a \\\\ 7n - 12 & \\text{if } n \\ge a \\end{cases}\\] For the function to be continuous at \\(n = a\\), the left-hand limit as \\(n\\) approaches \\(a\\) must equal the right-hand limit as \\(n\\) approaches \\(a\\), and both must equal \\(f(a)\\). In other words, \\[\\lim_{n \\to a^-} f(n) = \\lim_{n \\to a^+} f(n) = f(a)\\] The left-hand limit is given by the expression for \\(n < a\\), which is \\(4n + 3\\). The right-hand limit is given by the expression for \\(n \\ge a\\), which is \\(7n - 12\\). Since \\(f(a) = 7a - 12\\) (because \\(a \\ge a\\)), we need to set the left-hand limit equal to the right-hand limit and solve for \\(a\\). \\[\\lim_{n \\to a^-} (4n + 3) = \\lim_{n \\to a^+} (7n - 12)\\] So, \\(4a + 3 = 7a - 12\\). Let's solve this equation for \\(a\\). First, subtract \\(4a\\) from both sides: \\[3 = 3a - 12\\] Then, add 12 to both sides: \\[15 = 3a\\] Finally, divide both sides by 3: \\[a = 5\\] So, the value of \\(a\\) that makes the function continuous is \\(5\\). Let me check this by plugging \\(a = 5\\) back into the function definitions. For \\(n < 5\\), the function is \\(4n + 3\\), and for \\(n \\ge 5\\), the function is \\(7n - 12\\). The left-hand limit as \\(n\\) approaches 5 is \\(4(5) + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23\\). The right-hand limit as \\(n\\) approaches 5 is \\(7(5) - 12 = 35 - 12 = 23\\). And \\(f(5) = 7(5) - 12 = 35 - 12 = 23\\). Since the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at \\(n = 5\\) are all equal to 23, the function is indeed continuous at \\(n = 5\\). Therefore, the value of \\(a\\) is 5. \n",
