Since the line we're looking for is perpendicular, its slope \\(m'\\) should be the negative reciprocal of \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\), which is \\(-\\frac{4}{5}\\). That makes sense because \\(\\frac{5}{4} \\times -\\frac{4}{5} = -1\\), satisfying the perpendicular condition.\n",

      "I remember that when two triangles share the same vertex, like point A, and their bases are along the same line, the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases. But in this case, triangle AXY is not directly sharing a base with triangle ABC, but maybe I can break it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I recall that the area ratio can be found by multiplying the ratios of the corresponding sides. Specifically, if two triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. But are triangles AXY and ABC similar?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, let's check. For similarity, the corresponding angles must be equal. Since both triangles share angle A, and if the sides around angle A are proportional, then the triangles are similar. Let's check that.\n",

      "The ratio of AX to AB is 4/7, and the ratio of AY to AC is 6/10, which simplifies to 3/5. Hmm, 4/7 is approximately 0.571, and 3/5 is 0.6. So, they are not equal, which means the sides opposite angle A are not proportional. Therefore, the triangles are not similar. So, that approach won't work.\n",

      "Let's place point A at the origin (0,0). Then, since AB is a side of length 7, and let's assume AB is along the x-axis for simplicity. So, point B is at (7,0). Similarly, AC is a side of length 10, and I can place point C somewhere in the plane. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the coordinates of point C, only the lengths of AB and AC. So, maybe I need more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but perhaps it's better to assign coordinates in such a way that I can find coordinates for point C. Let me think. If I place A at (0,0), then since AB is 7 units, B is at (7,0). AC is 10 units, but I need to figure out the coordinates of C. Since the triangle isn't specified to be right-angled or anything, I can choose coordinates for C that satisfy the distances. For simplicity, let me place point C at (0,10). Wait, but then AC would be along the y-axis, but then AB is along the x-axis, so triangle ABC would be a right-angled triangle at A.\n",

Then, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with legs 7 and 10. Is that acceptable? It's a common technique to assign coordinates to make calculations easier, especially when dealing with sides and areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's do that. Let me set up a coordinate system where A is at (0,0), B is at (7,0), and C is at (0,10). Then, AB is from (0,0) to (7,0), AC is from (0,0) to (0,10), and BC is from (7,0) to (0,10). That seems reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, point X is on AB, and AX = 4. Since AB is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (7,0), point X must be at (4,0). Similarly, point Y is on AC, and AY = 6. Since AC is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,10), point Y must be at (0,6). So, now I have the coordinates of points A, X, and Y.\n",

      "So, the area of triangle ABC is 35.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle AXY to the area of triangle ABC is 12:35. So, as a fraction, that's 12/35.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the area of AXY.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since AXY is a right-angled triangle with legs AX = 4 and AY = 6, the area should be (4*6)/2 = 12. That matches what I got earlier. And ABC is a right-angled triangle with legs AB =7 and AC =10, so area is (7*10)/2 =35. So, 12/35 is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if I don't use coordinate geometry, I can think of it as the ratio of the bases times the ratio of the heights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since AX is 4/7 of AB and AY is 6/10 of AC, which is 3/5. If the two triangles share the same angle at A, then the ratio of their areas would be (AX/AB)*(AY/AC). So, that would be (4/7)*(6/10) = (24/70) = 12/35. That also gives the same result.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but hold on. In my first approach, I used coordinate geometry, but is it valid? Because in coordinate geometry, I assumed that point C is at (0,10), which made triangle ABC a right-angled triangle. But the problem didn't specify that triangle ABC is right-angled. So, is that an assumption I made?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, right! I didn't know that triangle ABC was right-angled. I assumed it was because I placed point C at (0,10). But in reality, triangle ABC could be any triangle with AB=7 and AC=10. So, my coordinate system might have made ABC a right-angled triangle, which might not be the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but does it matter? Because the areas I computed were based on the coordinates, but I didn't know the actual shape of ABC. So, maybe I shouldn't have assumed it was right-angled. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect. Let me think again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. Actually, in coordinate geometry, if I assign coordinates without knowing the type of triangle, the area calculations still hold because the coordinates are based on the distances given. But wait, since I assigned point A at (0,0), point B at (7,0), and point C at (0,10), which makes ABC a right-angled triangle, but in reality, ABC is not necessarily right-angled.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, is that a problem? Or is it acceptable because I chose coordinates such that ABC is right-angled, but the area ratio remains the same regardless of the actual triangle?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, because if the triangle isn't right-angled, the area can change depending on the coordinates. So, perhaps I need to use a more general approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle, but again, I don't know the angle at A.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I know the lengths of AX and AY, but not the lengths of XY or anything else. Hmm, maybe I can find the coordinates without assuming ABC is right-angled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's try that. Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (7,0), and point C at (c,d), where c and d are some real numbers such that the distance from A to C is 10. So, the distance from (0,0) to (c,d) is 10, which gives:\n",

      "Alright, so I have this problem here about projections onto vectors that are orthogonal. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the problem says that vectors a and b are orthogonal. Hmm, okay, so that means their dot product is zero. I remember that projections of a vector onto another vector can be found using the formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "proj_u v = ( (u ⋅ v) / ||u||² ) * u\n",
      "\n",
      "Where u is the vector onto which we're projecting, and v is the vector we're projecting onto. So, in this case, we're given that the projection of the vector [0, 13] onto a is [6, 4]. Let me write that down:\n",
      "\n",
      "proj_a [0; 13] = [6; 4]\n",
      "\n",
      "And we need to find the projection of the same vector [0; 13] onto b, which is orthogonal to a.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since a and b are orthogonal, they form a basis for the space, right? So any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b. That makes sense because they're orthogonal. So, in this case, since we're dealing with 2D vectors, we can write:\n",
      "\n",
      "[0; 13] = proj_a [0; 13] + proj_b [0; 13]\n",
      "\n",
      "Because if a and b are orthogonal, the projections onto them should add up to the original vector. Is that correct? Let me think about that. Yes, because if you project a vector onto two orthogonal subspaces and add the projections, you get the original vector back. That's similar to how in 3D, if you have orthogonal axes, you can decompose a vector into its components along each axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if that's the case, then:\n",
      "\n",
      "proj_b [0; 13] = [0; 13] - proj_a [0; 13]\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that proj_a [0; 13] is [6; 4], we can subtract that from [0; 13] to get the projection onto b.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's do that calculation:\n",
      "\n",
      "proj_b [0; 13] = [0; 13] - [6; 4] = [0 - 6; 13 - 4] = [-6; 9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify if that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since a and b are orthogonal, the projection of the vector onto b should be the leftover part after subtracting the projection onto a. So, if I project [0; 13] onto a, I get [6; 4], and the remaining part is [-6; 9], which should be the projection onto b.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me check if I can verify this another way. Maybe by using the formula for projection onto b, since a and b are orthogonal, the projection of v onto b should be zero when you project v onto a, and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the projection formula for b. It's similar to a:\n",
      "\n",
      "proj_b [0; 13] = ( ( [0; 13] ⋅ b ) / ||b||² ) * b\n",
      "\n",
      "But we don't know b yet. However, since a and b are orthogonal, their dot product is zero. So, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of the projections onto a and b should equal the original vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, in our earlier step, we used the fact that a and b are orthogonal to decompose the vector into two orthogonal components: one onto a and one onto b. That seems solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me also consider another approach. The projection of a vector onto a subspace is the closest vector in that subspace to the original vector. Since a and b are orthogonal, the projection onto a subspace spanned by a is just the component along a, and the projection onto the orthogonal complement (spanned by b) is the component along b.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if we have:\n",
      "\n",
      "proj_a v + proj_b v = v\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, proj_b v = v - proj_a v\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is exactly what we did earlier. So, that seems correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to be thorough, let me compute the norms or see if there's any inconsistency.\n",

      "We have proj_a v = [6; 4]. Let's compute its norm squared:\n",
      "\n",
      "||proj_a v||² = 6² + 4² = 36 + 16 = 52\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the norm squared of the projection is 52. The norm squared of [0; 13] is 0² + 13² = 169.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but if proj_a v is the projection, isn't it scaled? Because the projection formula is ( (v ⋅ a)/||a||² ) a, so the norm squared of proj_a v is ( (v ⋅ a)^2 ) / ||a||².\n",
      "\n",
      "But in our case, proj_a v = [6; 4], so let's compute the norm squared of that: 6² + 4² = 52 as above. So, ||proj_a v||² = 52.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the norm squared of v is ||v||² = 13² = 169. So, 52 is a fraction of 169, which is 52/169 = 4/13.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that means proj_a v is 4/13 times v. Is that the case?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me compute (v ⋅ a)/||a||². If proj_a v is [6; 4], then (v ⋅ a) / ||a||² must be 6 / 4 = 3/2? Wait, no, that can't be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me compute the dot product v ⋅ a. Let's denote a as [a1; a2]. Then, proj_a v = ( (v ⋅ a)/||a||² ) a = [6; 4]. So, let's compute (v ⋅ a)/||a||² times a equals [6; 4].\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me denote (v ⋅ a)/||a||² = k, so k * a = [6; 4]. So, k a1 = 6 and k a2 = 4. Therefore, a1 = 6/k, a2 = 4/k.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the norm squared of a is ||a||² = a1² + a2² = (36)/(k²) + (16)/(k²) = (52)/k².\n",
      "\n",
      "But we also have that proj_a v = [6; 4] = (k a) = k * [a1; a2] = k * [6/k; 4/k] = [6; 4], which is consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we don't know k yet. Wait, but we know that a and b are orthogonal. So, maybe we can use that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, if a and b are orthogonal, then the projection of v onto b is (v ⋅ b)/||b||² * b.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we don't know b yet. Hmm, perhaps we can use the fact that the projections onto a and b should add up to v.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I think I might be overcomplicating. Since we have that proj_a v + proj_b v = v, then proj_b v = v - proj_a v. So, as long as v is in the space spanned by a and b, which it is, since we're projecting it onto a and b.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, proj_b v should be [0; 13] minus [6; 4], which is [-6; 9].\n",
      "\n",
      "That makes sense, right? Because if I project [0;13] onto a, I get [6;4], and the remaining part is [-6;9], which should be the projection onto b.\n",

      "Let me just make sure that this is consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me check if [6;4] is indeed the projection of [0;13] onto a. \n",
      "\n",
      " ====================================================================================================\n",
      " So, if a is some vector, then the projection is [6;4]. So, to get that, the vector a must satisfy:\n",
      "\n",
      "proj_a v = ( (v ⋅ a)/||a||² ) a = [6;4]\n",

      "( (0*a1 + 13*a2)/||a||² ) * [a1; a2] = [6;4]\n",

      "(13 a2 a1) / (13 a2²) = (6 ||a||²) / (4 ||a||²)\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplify:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a1)/a2 = 6/4 = 3/2\n",
      "\n",
      "So, a1 = (3/2) a2\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me denote a2 as 2k, so a1 becomes 3k.\n",

    "Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: In triangle ABC, CD is the bisector of angle C, with D on AB. We're given that cos(C/2) = 1/3 and CD = 6. We need to compute 1/BC + 1/AC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, okay. So, triangle ABC, with angle C being bisected by CD, where D is on AB. We have some trigonometric information about angle C and the length of the angle bisector CD. And we need to compute the sum of the reciprocals of sides BC and AC. Maybe I should draw inspiration form another question.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the problem says that vectors a and b are orthogonal. Hmm, okay, so that means their dot product is zero. I remember that projections of a vector onto another vector can be found using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "proj_u v = ( (u ⋅ v) / ||u||² ) * u\n",
    "\n",
    "Where u is the vector onto which we're projecting, and v is the vector we're projecting onto. So, in this case, we're given that the projection of the vector [0, 13] onto a is [6, 4]. Let me write that down:\n",
    "\n",
    "proj_a [0; 13] = [6; 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "And we need to find the projection of the same vector [0; 13] onto b, which is orthogonal to a.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a and b are orthogonal, they form a basis for the space, right? So any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b. That makes sense because they're orthogonal. So, in this case, since we're dealing with 2D vectors, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "[0; 13] = proj_a [0; 13] + proj_b [0; 13]\n",
    "\n",
    "Because if a and b are orthogonal, the projections onto them should add up to the original vector. Is that correct? Let me think about that. Yes, because if you project a vector onto two orthogonal subspaces and add the projections, you get the original vector back. That's similar to how in 3D, if you have orthogonal axes, you can decompose a vector into its components along each axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if that's the case, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "proj_b [0; 13] = [0; 13] - proj_a [0; 13]\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that proj_a [0; 13] is [6; 4], we can subtract that from [0; 13] to get the projection onto b.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's do that calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "proj_b [0; 13] = [0; 13] - [6; 4] = [0 - 6; 13 - 4] = [-6; 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify if that makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a and b are orthogonal, the projection of the vector onto b should be the leftover part after subtracting the projection onto a. So, if I project [0; 13] onto a, I get [6; 4], and the remaining part is [-6; 9], which should be the projection onto b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me check if I can verify this another way. Maybe by using the formula for projection onto b, since a and b are orthogonal, the projection of v onto b should be zero when you project v onto a, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me recall the projection formula for b. It's similar to a:\n",
    "\n",
    "proj_b [0; 13] = ( ( [0; 13] ⋅ b ) / ||b||² ) * b\n",
    "\n",
    "But we don't know b yet. However, since a and b are orthogonal, their dot product is zero. So, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of the projections onto a and b should equal the original vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, in our earlier step, we used the fact that a and b are orthogonal to decompose the vector into two orthogonal components: one onto a and one onto b. That seems solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me also consider another approach. The projection of a vector onto a subspace is the closest vector in that subspace to the original vector. Since a and b are orthogonal, the projection onto a subspace spanned by a is just the component along a, and the projection onto the orthogonal complement (spanned by b) is the component along b.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "proj_a v + proj_b v = v\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, proj_b v = v - proj_a v\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is exactly what we did earlier. So, that seems correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to be thorough, let me compute the norms or see if there's any inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have proj_a v = [6; 4]. Let's compute its norm squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "||proj_a v||² = 6² + 4² = 36 + 16 = 52\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the norm squared of the projection is 52. The norm squared of [0; 13] is 0² + 13² = 169.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, but if proj_a v is the projection, isn't it scaled? Because the projection formula is ( (v ⋅ a)/||a||² ) a, so the norm squared of proj_a v is ( (v ⋅ a)^2 ) / ||a||².\n",
    "\n",
    "But in our case, proj_a v = [6; 4], so let's compute the norm squared of that: 6² + 4² = 52 as above. So, ||proj_a v||² = 52.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the norm squared of v is ||v||² = 13² = 169. So, 52 is a fraction of 169, which is 52/169 = 4/13.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, that means proj_a v is 4/13 times v. Is that the case?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, let me compute (v ⋅ a)/||a||². If proj_a v is [6; 4], then (v ⋅ a) / ||a||² must be 6 / 4 = 3/2? Wait, no, that can't be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, let me compute the dot product v ⋅ a. Let's denote a as [a1; a2]. Then, proj_a v = ( (v ⋅ a)/||a||² ) a = [6; 4]. So, let's compute (v ⋅ a)/||a||² times a equals [6; 4].\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me denote (v ⋅ a)/||a||² = k, so k * a = [6; 4]. So, k a1 = 6 and k a2 = 4. Therefore, a1 = 6/k, a2 = 4/k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the norm squared of a is ||a||² = a1² + a2² = (36)/(k²) + (16)/(k²) = (52)/k².\n",
    "\n",
    "But we also have that proj_a v = [6; 4] = (k a) = k * [a1; a2] = k * [6/k; 4/k] = [6; 4], which is consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we don't know k yet. Wait, but we know that a and b are orthogonal. So, maybe we can use that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, if a and b are orthogonal, then the projection of v onto b is (v ⋅ b)/||b||² * b.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we don't know b yet. Hmm, perhaps we can use the fact that the projections onto a and b should add up to v.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, I think I might be overcomplicating. Since we have that proj_a v + proj_b v = v, then proj_b v = v - proj_a v. So, as long as v is in the space spanned by a and b, which it is, since we're projecting it onto a and b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, proj_b v should be [0; 13] minus [6; 4], which is [-6; 9].\n",
    "\n",
    "That makes sense, right? Because if I project [0;13] onto a, I get [6;4], and the remaining part is [-6;9], which should be the projection onto b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me just make sure that this is consistent.\n",
