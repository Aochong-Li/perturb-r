      "Alright, so I need to find the midpoint of the line segment connecting points P(5,3) and Q(-3,6). Hmm, okay, midpoints. I remember that the midpoint formula is something like taking the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the two points. Let me try to recall the exact formula.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's ( (x1 + x2)/2 , (y1 + y2)/2 ). Yeah, that seems right. So, for points P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2), the midpoint M is given by M = ( (x1 + x2)/2 , (y1 + y2)/2 ). Okay, so let's plug in the values from points P and Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "Point P is (5,3), so x1 is 5 and y1 is 3. Point Q is (-3,6), so x2 is -3 and y2 is 6. So, substituting these into the formula, the x-coordinate of the midpoint would be (5 + (-3))/2, and the y-coordinate would be (3 + 6)/2. Let me compute each part step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's compute the x-coordinate: 5 + (-3) is the same as 5 - 3, which equals 2. Then, we divide that by 2, so 2/2 is 1. So, the x-coordinate of the midpoint is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for the y-coordinate: 3 + 6 is 9. Then, we divide that by 2, which gives us 4.5. Hmm, 4.5 is the same as 9/2. So, the y-coordinate is 4.5 or 9/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the midpoint M is (1, 4.5). I should probably write that as a fraction instead of a decimal for consistency, so 4.5 is equal to 9/2. Therefore, the midpoint is (1, 9/2). Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the x-coordinates: 5 and -3. Adding them together: 5 + (-3) is indeed 2. Divided by 2 gives 1. That seems correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the y-coordinates: 3 and 6. Adding them together: 3 + 6 is 9. Divided by 2 gives 4.5 or 9/2. That looks right too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the midpoint is (1, 9/2). I don't think I made any errors here. The formula is straightforward, and the arithmetic checks out. Let me just visualize it to ensure it makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Point P is at (5,3), which is in the first quadrant, right? And point Q is at (-3,6), which is in the second quadrant because the x-coordinate is negative. So, the midpoint should be somewhere in between these two points. \n",
      "\n",
      " ====================================================================================================\n",
      " Since P is further to the right and a bit lower, while Q is to the left and higher, the midpoint being at (1, 4.5) seems reasonable. It's somewhere closer to P than to Q, but not too close. Hmm, actually, let me think about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the midpoint should be exactly halfway between P and Q, regardless of their positions. So, if I imagine a line connecting (5,3) and (-3,6), the midpoint should be right in the center. 1 is exactly halfway between 5 and -3 on the x-axis, and 4.5 is halfway between 3 and 6 on the y-axis. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think my answer is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to check is to use the distance formula. If M is the midpoint, then the distance from P to M should be equal to the distance from Q to M.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's compute the distance between P(5,3) and M(1,9/2). Using the distance formula: sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].\n",
      "\n",
      "So, sqrt[(1 - 5)^2 + (9/2 - 3)^2] = sqrt[(-4)^2 + (3/2)^2] = sqrt[16 + 9/4] = sqrt[64/4 + 9/4] = sqrt[73/4] = sqrt(73)/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's compute the distance between Q(-3,6) and M(1,9/2). sqrt[(1 - (-3))^2 + (9/2 - 6)^2] = sqrt[(4)^2 + (-3/2)^2] = sqrt[16 + 9/4] = sqrt[64/4 + 9/4] = sqrt[73/4] = sqrt(73)/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, both distances are equal, which confirms that M is indeed the midpoint. Therefore, my answer is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's thorough enough. I considered the formula, computed each coordinate step by step, double-checked my arithmetic, visualized the points, and even verified using the distance formula. So, yeah, (1, 9/2) is the midpoint.\n",

Wait, no, actually, arcsin has a range of [-π/2, π/2], and arccos has [0, π], and arctan has (-π/2, π/2). Let me confirm that. Yeah, arcsin(x) is defined for x in [-1,1], and its outputs are between -π/2 and π/2. Arctan is defined for all real numbers, but its output is between -π/2 and π/2 as well. So, since the function f(x) includes arcsin(x), the domain of f(x) must be restricted to the domain of arcsin(x), which is [-1,1]. So f(x) is only defined for x between -1 and 1. \n",

      "Therefore, we can consider x in [-1, 1]. So to find the range of f(x), we need to see what values f(x) can take as x varies from -1 to 1. Since both arctan(x) and arcsin(x) are continuous functions on this interval, their sum (with the coefficient 1/2) will also be continuous, so the range will be an interval.
