So if we have elements less than a_i, then the number of subsets where a_i is the maximum is 2^{k}, where k is the number of elements less than a_i. But since the subsets are nonempty, but if we include a_i, and any combination of elements less than a_i, then the total number is 2^{k} - 1? Wait, no.

Since the subsets are nonempty, but if we include a_i and any combination of elements less than a_i, then the total number is 2^{k} where k is the number of elements less than a_i. Because each element less than a_i can be either included or not. However, if we include a_i, then the subset is nonempty. Wait, but if we have a_i and nothing else, that's a valid subset. So the number of subsets where a_i is the maximum is 2^{k}, where k is the number of elements less than a_i.

Because the subsets can include any subset of the elements less than a_i (there are i - 1 elements less than a_i, so 2^{i - 1} subsets), and then we must include a_i. So total subsets for each a_i is 2^{i - 1}. But wait, but if you include a_i and any subset of the elements less than a_i, then the subsets are nonempty. So for example, if A is {a₁, a₂, a₃}, then the number of subsets with maximum a₁ is 1 (just {a₁}), subsets with maximum a₂ is 2^{2 - 1} = 2? Wait, no. Wait, if the elements less than a₂ are a₁, then the number of subsets where maximum is a₂ is 2^{1} = 2. Which would be {a₂} and {a₁, a₂}. Similarly, the number of subsets where maximum is a₃ is 2^{2} = 4. Which are {a₃}, {a₁, a₃}, {a₂, a₃}, {a₁, a₂, a₃}. So total subsets would be 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Then, for each subset B of the positive integers, with maximum element in A. So, for each element a in A, we can consider all subsets where a is the maximum element. So, for each a in A, the number of subsets where a is the maximum element is equal to the number of subsets of the positive integers that contain a and do not contain any elements greater than a. So, if we fix a as the maximum element, then the subsets must contain a and any subset of the elements less than a. So, the number of such subsets is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a - 1} (since elements less than a are 1 to a - 1) and then we have to include a. Therefore, the number of subsets where a is the maximum is 2^{a - 1} (since each element less than a can be included or not, and we have to include a). However, note that the elements of B can be any positive integers, but the maximum is a. So, for example, if a is 1, then the only subset is {1}. If a is 2, then subsets are {2}, {1, 2}. If a is 3, subsets are {3}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}. So the number of subsets where the maximum is a is 2^{a - 1}. However, note that the elements of B can be any positive integers, not necessarily in A. But the maximum is a, so the other elements must be less than or equal to a. However, since the elements of B are positive integers, but the maximum is a, then the other elements can be any positive integers less than or equal to a. However, the problem is that if we have elements greater than a in B, then the maximum would be greater than a, which is not allowed. Therefore, for a given a, the number of subsets where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a} that contain a and do not contain any elements greater than a. But since the elements are positive integers, and a is fixed, then the number of such subsets is equal to 2^{a - 1} because each element less than a can be included or not, and a must be included. But wait, the elements of the subset can be any positive integers, but the maximum is a. Therefore, the subsets can have elements from 1 to a, but not elements greater than a. So the number of subsets where the maximum is a is 2^{a - 1}. However, the elements of B can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a}, with a included.
