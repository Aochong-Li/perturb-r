      "Alright, so I've got this function here, f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2), and I need to find the value of f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0). Hmm, okay. Let me see. I think I should just plug in each of those x-values into the function one by one and then add them up. Sounds straightforward, but let me make sure I don't make any mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with f(-2). So, wherever there's an x, I'll substitute -2. That gives me (3*(-2) - 2) divided by (-2 - 2). Let me calculate the numerator first: 3 times -2 is -6, minus 2 is -8. Then the denominator is -2 - 2, which is -4. So, f(-2) is -8 divided by -4. Hmm, negative divided by negative is positive, so that's 2. Okay, that seems good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up is f(-1). Plugging -1 into the function: (3*(-1) - 2) over (-1 - 2). Numerator: 3 times -1 is -3, minus 2 is -5. Denominator: -1 - 2 is -3. So, f(-1) is -5 divided by -3. Again, negatives cancel out, so that's 5/3. Got that.\n",

      "Now, f(0). Plugging in 0: (3*0 - 2)/(0 - 2). Numerator: 0 minus 2 is -2. Denominator: 0 - 2 is -2. So, f(0) is -2 divided by -2, which is 1. Easy enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so f(-2) is 2, f(-1) is 5/3, and f(0) is 1. Now, I need to add them all together. So, 2 + 5/3 + 1. Hmm, let me convert 2 and 1 into fractions with a denominator of 3 to add them up easily. 2 is 6/3, and 1 is 3/3. So, adding 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 gives me (6 + 5 + 3)/3, which is 14/3. Wait, that seems right?\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with f(-2): (3*(-2) - 2) is -6 - 2, which is -8. Denominator: (-2 - 2) is -4. So, -8/-4 is indeed 2. That looks correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "f(-1): (3*(-1) - 2) is -3 - 2, which is -5. Denominator: (-1 - 2) is -3. So, -5/-3 is 5/3. Yup, that's correct.\n",

      "\n",
      "I was a bit worried because sometimes when dealing with fractions, especially when adding, it's easy to slip up, but going through each step carefully, I think that's solid. Each function evaluation was straightforward, so adding them up shouldn't be too bad. \n",
